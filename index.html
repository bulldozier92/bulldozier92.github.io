    <h1>My name is John Dozier</h1>

    <p>I am a Data Science and Programming Support Services student. In my free time I like to practice archery and shooting, when the weather permits safe conditions I also enjoy bass fishing. When I want to do something but not spend money, I will typically play video games on my computer; it is very up-to-date and I built it myself. I've been a PC gamer since 1999.</p>
